### How long you spent on the assignment:
4 hours

### What you like about your implementation:
I was not able to complete the implementation as I intended. As a result, there is logic in the UI (which should be in the ViewModel), and the code is not as organized as it could be. However, I like what I was able to achieve, especially how the app navigates through the weeks. Unfortunately, I had several problems, such as the scaffold code not working and new Android Studio projects having strange errors, which cost me about an hour. Despite this, I believe I got a good result given the circumstances. It was a great experience, and even though the deadline has passed, I'll keep working on it to achieve my intended result.

### What you would change if you were going to do it again:
I would do a better job with the UI and code organization.

### How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
My design is far from what I was aiming for. It was supposed to look like Google Calendar, but I ran out of time.

### How you would test this if you had more time:
I would unit test the UI logic. Since I was working with an intent strategy, I would create intents for the operations a user could do, such as opening, editing, deleting, or creating an event. I would then test that the intended logic would run upon the emission of those events. For example, in the case of a "create event" intent, I would assert that the new item sent with the event is now in the database.
