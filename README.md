- How long you spent on the assignment.
4 hours
- What you like about your implementation.
  I was not able to complete the implementation as i itended. So there is logic in the UI (which should be in the ViewModel), the code is
  not as organized as it could. But i like what i could achieve, mostly how the app is able to navigate trough the weeks. Unfortunetly i had several problems,
  like the scaffold code not working, android studio new projects with strange errors, all that cost me 1 hour. But still i think i got a
  good result based on the circunstances, it was a great experience, and even tho the time has passed ill keep working on it to achieve the result
  i itend to.
  
- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
  I would do a better job with the UI and code organization.
  
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
  My design is far away from what i was going to. It was supost to look like Google Calendar, but the time was too fast.

- How you would test this if you had more time.
  I would unit test the UI logic. Since i was working with Intent strategy, i would create intents for the operations the user
  could do, like open event, edit event, delete event, create event, etc. And i would test that with the emition of those events the
  intended logic would run. For example, in case of a create event, i would assert that the new item sent with the event is now on
  the database.
